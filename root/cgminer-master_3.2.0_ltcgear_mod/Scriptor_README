A hacked version of cgminer to work with Scriptors. Based on BFLSC driver/protocol.

Make sure you have installed all prerequisites before compiling.

You may run ./configure if required, e.g.
CFLAGS="-g -march=native" ./configure --disable-opencl  --disable-adl --enable-bflsc --enable-scrypt 
but you will have to edit config.h and add:

#define USE_SCRYPT 1


After ./configure, 'make'


To start:


 ./cgminer --scrypt -T -o <pool_address>:3333 -u <pool_user> -p<password>
 
 
For USB xfers debug and low levels, edit usbutils.c, line 333, change '#if 0' to '#if 1'.
