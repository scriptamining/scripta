Inital information compiled from lots of good stuff around Scripta at litecointalk
[fourm posts](https://litecointalk.org/index.php?topic=9908.msg143787#msg143787)

1. Started with Scripta 1.1 [image](http://www.lateralfactory.com/download.php?file=scripta-1_1.tgz)
  * source files in image do not match current Scripta [repo](https://github.com/scriptamining/scripta.git)  
  * rsync github files to image to get starting code base (all uses of "minepeon" replaced with "scripta")
  * origianl MinePeon [project](http://minepeon.com/index.php/Main_Page) has lots of good PI setup and helpful info
    
2. Update raspberry to newest kernel (3.10.33+) and added 'slub_debug=FP' to bootline.conf
  * this should fix the wierd USB debug error logging issues.   

3. Set ssh port to 22.  Should probably turn off root ssh access and change password.  
  ssh root@10.0.1.28  
  root password: scripta
  web password: scripta
    
4. Change locales to en_US

5. Add wifi support (wlan0)
  * set ssid and psk in `network` block at `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`

6. Build GridSeed GS3355 specific version of cgminer with mulit-frequency support from [repo](https://github.com/girnyau/cgminer-gc3355)
  * modified cgminer-gc3355 to report Frequency and Serial in API calls: [repo](https://github.com/mox235/cgminer-gc3355)

7. Edit `/opt/scripta/startup/miner-start.sh` to use cgminer-gc3355

8. Remove Scripta LTC donation address.  Disable MinePeon BTC hash time donation option.  Need to determine the right thing to do since _most_ of the web interface stuff is directly from the [MinePeonUI project](https://github.com/MineForeman/zArchive-MinePeonWebUI.git)
  * other Scripta rebranded PI images at [Crypto Pros](http://www.cryptopros.com/2014/03/gridseed-dual-miner-first-look-amazing.html) 
  * and [Hash Master](https://hash-master.com/blog/using-your-raspberry-pi-as-a-gridseed-mining-controller/)
  * different PI web-based controller for Gridseed at [Hashra](https://github.com/HASHRA)

9. Fix pool URL JSON encoding.  Add back miner config name/values settings from MinePeonUI.  All cgminer settings can be changed or added from miner form. 
  * priority used to reorder pool list
  * ability to set per GSD frequency based on Serial # from freq list: 
  ```
        static const int opt_frequency[] = {
            700,  706,  713,  719,  725,  731,  738,  744,
            750,  756,  763,  769,  775,  781,  788,  794,
            800,  813,  825,  838,  850,  863,  875,  888,
            900,  913,  925,  938,  950,  963,  975,  988,
           1000, 1013, 1025, 1038, 1050, 1063, 1075, 1088,
           1100, 1113, 1125, 1138, 1150, 1163, 1175, 1188,
           1200, 1213, 1225, 1238, 1250, 1263, 1275, 1288,
           1300, 1313, 1325, 1338, 1350, 1363, 1375, 1388,
           1400,
             -1
        };
  ```
10. Modify Status table
  * show KHs instead of MHs
  * replace Name with GSD Serial Number
  * replace Temperature with Frequency
  * remove percentages for DiffAccept and DiffReject 
    
11. Open Issues
  * maybe reported [hashrate](http://cryptomining-blog.com/1760-what-is-the-actual-hashrate-you-get-from-your-gridseed-asic/) is not quite accurate
  * something weird with system time display, timezone, day-light savings
  * graphs should auto-refresh when /status page loads

scripta-20140401

  * updated PI firmware to maybe fix usb slub crash
  * fix cgminer to always start at boot `/etc/rc.local`
  * gzip image

  * install [watchdog](http://linux.die.net/man/8/watchdog) service
  * load `bcm2708_wdog` kernel module
  * modify `/opt/watchdog.conf` to reboot PI if bad things happen.  See below. 
  * add UI option for cgminer specific watchdog script `/opt/scripta/bin/wdog.py`.  See below.
  * add/fix UI option for manual reboot
  * option for email notification on PI automatic reboot.  *YOUR EMAIL PASSWORD IS STORED IN PLAIN TEXT SO PLAN ACCORDINGLY*  
  
Once the watchdog is enabled, it is possible to get in a reboot loop.  If this happens, disable the system watchdog by quick edit of `/etc/watchdog.conf` after boot and comment out `watchdog-device = /dev/watchdog`.  The cgminer API based watchdog script can be disabled by using the UI checkbox or commenting out `test-binary = /opt/scripta/bin/wdog.py` in the same config file.  You will have about 30 seconds each loop to try and unscrew things.   

The system watchdog daemon will check the following every 30 seconds:
  - sytem load less than 24/18/12
  - more than 1 page of RAM available
  - syslog still alive
  - cgminer specific watchdog script `/opt/scripta/bin/wdog.py` that uses the following logic:

  ```
  if (UI manual reboot)
  {
    force PI reboot
  }
  if (UI auto reboot)
  {
    if (sytem up for more than 60 seconds)
    {
      if (cgminer process not running)
      {
        if (UI enable) send email
        force PI reboot
      }
      if (ASIC device count less UI device count)
      {
        if (UI enable) send email
        force PI reboot
      }
      for (each ASIC device)
      {
        if (device hashrate less than UI value)
        {
          if (UI enable) send email
          force PI reboot
        }
      }
    }
  }
  OK (yay!!!)
  ```
  - watchdog details logged to syslog

scripta-20140423

  * Install wicd and wicd-curses to help with WiFi network configuration.  Use `wicd-curses` to setup your WiFi.
  * Fixed double emails from "cgminer process not running" reboot.
  * Update openssl (heartbleed)
  * Upgrade/downgrade rpi firmware to use 3.10.36+ kernel.  Maybe more stable USB than 20140408 version using "next" branch (??)
  * Replace miner with bfgminer for stability.  Update browser options to display status.  No longer able to set/display individual GSD clock frequencies.
  
Miner bfgminer 3.99.0 seems to be more stable than wierd cgminer 3.7.2 branch.  Ongoing gridseed support scheduled to be merged into main bfgminer in next (4.0.0) main version release.
